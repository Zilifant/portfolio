### My portfolio / personal website.
A single-page site built with Svelte, SCSS, and a bit of JSON. Hosted on Vercel. A work in progress; pardon the mess.

### Somewhat notable features:
- Light/dark mode utilizing `local storage` to save your choice.
- The site doesn't use url hashes for navigation. But it can *detect* them and load relevant content, e.g. [scottsilsbe.com/#resume](https://www.scottsilsbe.com/#resume).
- A totally sweet science fiction story.
